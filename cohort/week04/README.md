Before running/executing these Java source file scripts, please ensure that [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) (Client & WebDriver Language Bindings for Java), [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) and a corresponding W3C browser WebDriver of your choice are already installed first. If you are using the `.jar` files ([this one](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.junit.platform/junit-platform-console-standalone) for JUnit 5) instead of using dependency managers such as Gradle or Maven, place them in your directory path of choice and include/indicate the relevant paths in the corresponding Java build classpath. For the WebDriver executable file, you can either pass the file as the `vmargs` properties into the JVM or add its path into your system's `$PATH` environment variable.

These scripts utilize the GeckoDriver WebDriver.
