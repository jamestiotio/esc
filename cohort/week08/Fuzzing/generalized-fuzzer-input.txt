Implement
a
generalized
fuzzer
that
will
take
a
file,
read
each
line
of
the
file,
randomly
choose
a
mutation
operator
(swap,
bit
flip
or
trim)
and
produce
a
different
file
with
the
modified
lines.
This
means
for
each
input
file,
the
fuzzer
will
produce
one
output
file,
where
each 
line
is
modified
with
a
random
mutation
operator.
Choose
any
programming
language.
Make
your
program
modular
so
that
more
mutation
operators
can
be
added
easily.
